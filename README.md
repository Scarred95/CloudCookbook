## Project Overview
**CloudCookbook** is a **Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)** platform designed to demonstrate robust Cloud Engineering principles.
It allows multiple users to register, manage private ingredient inventories (Pantries), and access a shared community cookbook, all running on a containerized AWS environment.

### Key Goals
* **Multi-Tenancy:** Strict data isolation where users manage private pantries.
* **Persistent Storage:** Relational data modeling
* **Infrastructure as Code:** Full deployment using AWS.
